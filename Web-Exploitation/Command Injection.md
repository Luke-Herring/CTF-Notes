# Command Injection
command injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server

				Basic command injection
Shopping application that lets the user view whether an item is in stock.We can use `Metacharacters` to add another command.

			Blind command injection using time delays
Using a time delay is a good way to know that command injection is exploitable.

Example:
The ping command is great for time delays

			Blind commmand injection by redirecting output
You can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that you can then retrieve using your browser.			
			
Example:
![](Command4.png)
Then we can grab that file which will execute the command `whoami`

					Metacharacters
Metacharacters can be used as command seperators. Allowing commands to be chained together.

Metacharacters:
- &
-  &&
-  |
-  ||
- ;
- `
