# Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client.

Example:
- `Knownledge factors` A password or the answer to a security question. 
- `possession factors` A physical object like a mobile phone or security token.
- `inherence factors` Your biometrics or patterns of behavior.
