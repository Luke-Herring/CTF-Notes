# Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client.

Types of Authentication:
- `Knownledge factors` A password or the answer to a security question. 
- `Possession factors` A physical object like a mobile phone or security token.
- `Inherence factors` Your biometrics or patterns of behavior.

 **Flawed 2FA Logic:**
-- sometimes flawed logic in 2FA means that after a user has completed the initial login step, the website doesn't verify that the same user is completing the second step.

**Brute-Forcing 2FA codes:**
2FA codes are often a 4-6 digit number.This is easily cracked using `Sequencer` extension in Burpsuite
