					Types of emails
-    Spam - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as MalSpam

-   Phishing -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 
   
-   Spear phishing - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.  
   
-   Whaling - is similar to spear phishing, but it's targeted specifically to C-Level high-position individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.), and the objective is the same. 
   
-   Smishing- takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 

-   Vishing - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls.
