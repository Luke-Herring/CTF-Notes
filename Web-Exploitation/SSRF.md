# Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
SSRF is a vulnerability in web applications whereby an attacker can make further HTTP requests through the server. An attacker can make use of this vulnerability to communicate with any internal services on the server's network which are generally protected by firewalls.

	Types of SSRF
- normal SSRF where data is returned to the attacker's screen
- Blind SSRF where an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker's screen.

			Attack vectors
- Partial URLS in requests
- URLS within data formats
- SSRF via referer header

				SSRF against the server itself
The attacker induces the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface. This will typically involve supplying a URL with a hostname like `127.0.0.1`

Example:

A shopping application lets users view whether an item is in stock. To provide the stock 
information, the application queries a back-end REST API. This function is implemented by passing the URL to the back-end API endpoint via a front-end HTTP request. So when users view the stock status for an item, their browser makes a request like this:

This causes the server to make a request to the specified URL, retrieve the stock status, and return this to the user. The attacker can modify the request to specify a URL local to the server itself.

				SSRF against other back-end systems
Another type of trust relationship that often arises with `SSRF` is where the application server is able to interact with other back-end systems that are not directly reachable by users. These systems often have non-routable private IP addresses. Since the back-end systems are normally protected by the network topology, they often have a weaker security. In many cases, internal back-end systems contain sensitive functionality that can be accessed without authentication by anyone who is able to interact with the systems.
