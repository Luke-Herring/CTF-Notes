# XML external entity (XXE) Injection
XXE injection is a web security vulnerability that allows us to interfere with the processing of XML data. It often allows us to view files on the server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access.

Types of XXE attacks
- `XXE to retrieve files` An external entity is containing the contents of a file, and is returned in the response.
- `XXE to SSRF` An external entity is defined based on a URL to a back-end system.
- `Blind XXE exfiltrate data out-of-band` sensitive data is transmitted from the application server to a system that the attacker controls.
- `Blind XXE to retrieve data via error messagess` we Can trigger a parsing error message containing sensitive data.
