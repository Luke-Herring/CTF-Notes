# Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client.

Types of Authentication:
- `Knownledge factors` A password or the answer to a security question. 
- `Possession factors` A physical object like a mobile phone or security token.
- `Inherence factors` Your biometrics or patterns of behavior.

### Knowledge Factor

				Password-based login
**brute-Force Passwords:**

### Possession Factor

				Two-factor authentication(2FA)
**Bypassing 2FA:**
- Log in to your own account make sure to have two tabs open.
- Log out from of the tabs and login to the victims account
- refresh other tab and you should be looged in

 **Flawed 2FA Logic:**
sometimes flawed logic in 2FA means that after a user has completed the initial login step, the website doesn't verify that the same user is completing the second step.

Example:

 user logins with their credentials

You are then assigned a cookie that relates to your account

When submitting the verification code, the request uses this cookie to determine which account the user is trying to access:

The attacker could log in using their own credentials but then change the value of the account cookie to any arbitrary username when submitting the verification code.

**Brute-Forcing 2FA codes:**
2FA codes are often a 4-6 digit number.This is easily cracked using `Sequencer` extension in Burpsuite

### Inherence Factor
