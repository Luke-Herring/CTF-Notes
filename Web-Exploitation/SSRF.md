# Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
SSRF is a vulnerability in web applications whereby an attacker can make further HTTP requests through the server. An attacker can make use of this vulnerability to communicate with any internal services on the server's network which are generally protected by firewalls.

	Types of SSRF
- normal SSRF where data is returned to the attacker's screen
- Blind SSRF where an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker's screen.

				SSRF against the server itself
The attacker induces the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface. This will typically involve supplying a URL with a hostname like `127.0.0.1`
