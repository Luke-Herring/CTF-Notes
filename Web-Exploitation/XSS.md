				Attack Vectors

-- Customizable Themes & Profiles via CSS
-- Event or meeting names
-- URI based
-- Imported from a 3rd party (think Facebook integration)
-- JSON POST Values (check returning content type)
-- File Upload names
-- Uploaded files (swf, HTML, ++)
-- Custom Error pages
-- fake params - ?realparam=1&foo=bar’+alert(/XSS/)+’
-- Login and Forgot password forms

				Reflected XSS
-- supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.	

-- Parameters in the URL Query String
-- URL File Path
-- Sometimes HTTP Headers


				Stored XSS
				
-- the XSS payload is stored on the web application and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.

-- Comments on a blog
-- User profile information  
-- Website Listings

				Dom Based XSS
		
--JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code.

-- Crafted links could be sent to potential victims, redirecting them to another website or steal content from the page or the user's session.
				
				Blind XSS
				
-- your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.

-- xsshunter
